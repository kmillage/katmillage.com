### About the Paper 

In our new paper, just published in Environmental Research Letters, we propose a new institution to finance enforcmeent of marine protected areas (MPAs)---a 'conservation finance area' (CFA)---where limited fishing leases are allowed and the lease money finances enforcmeent of the MPA.
