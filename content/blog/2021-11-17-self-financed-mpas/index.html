<h3>About the Paper</h3>
<p>A new paper that I led in collaboration with Juan Carlos Villaseñor-Derbez, Darcy Bradley, Matthew Burgess, Hunter Lenihan, and Christopher Costello was just published in Environmental Research Letters! In <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac3439">this new paper</a> entitled “Self-financed marine protected areas” we propose a new institution to finance enforcement of marine protected areas (MPAs)—a ‘conservation finance area’ (CFA)—where limited fishing leases are allowed and the lease money finances enforcement of the MPA.</p>

<h3>Key Findings</h3>
<p>Using a bioeconomic model we show that CFAs can fully finance MPA enforcement, deter illegal fishing, and ultimately maximize fish biomass. Moreover, we show that unless a large, exogenous, and perpetual enforcement budget is available, implementing a CFA in a no-take MPA always results in high biomass than without. </br></p>

</p>
<p>We conclude by exploring the real-world enabling conditions that would support such an institution, and highlight some real-world systems that share many features with CFAs to suggest that our proposed institution is a viable policy solution.</p>
