I recently presented a virtual workshop for the [EcoDataScience](https://eco-data-science.github.io/) group at the University of California, Santa Barbara on the basics of *Shiny* app development with a focus on the packages and approaches that I regularly utilize. 

The GitHub repository containing all materials for the workshop can be found [here](https://github.com/kmillage/shiny-for-ecodatascience).

The slides used in the workshop are [here](/blog/misc-files/shiny_for_ecodatascience.html).
